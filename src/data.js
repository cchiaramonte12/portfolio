        I wanted to take on this project to really deepen my understanding of sorting algorithms. \
        I also think that an application like this could be really helpful for students like myself studying for interviews. \
        So far I have gotten the merge sort algorithm to function and animate. \
        The animation is certainly the hardest part. \
        I still have to finish implementing and testing the rest of the sorting algorithms and then get to work on their animations.",
